# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to porybox. To keep things organized, please follow these guidelines:

## Bugs/Issues

To report a bug with porybox, [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/porybox/porybox/issues/new) for it. Please try to include any information that might be relevant (e.g. What browser are you using? What did you expect to happen?)

If you find a **security issue** with porybox, please do *not* report it on GitHub; instead, please report it [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_-w0iRZ-l-7Ph4RKxKuP0QhAKzq3YOj19RY778LsujDp-qQ/viewform). A security issue is a bug that could be used to compromise the server or the integrity/privacy of its data if used maliciously. For example, a bug that allowed a private Pok√©mon to be downloaded by someone other than its owner would be a security issue.

## Adding features/code

To contribute code to porybox, make a pull request to the `master` branch. Please be sure that the linter passes without any warnings, and that all of the unit tests pass. You can check this by starting a local database server and running `npm test`. If you are submitting a new feature or a bugfix, please also add test(s) for it.

  <h2>Usage</h2>

  <p><b>How do I register?</b><br>
  Go the <a href="/">main page</a> and fill the form to create an account.<br>
  </p>

  <p><b>How do I upload Pokémon?</b><br>
  To upload a Pokémon on Porybox, you need:<br>
  <ul>
  <li>A Porybox account</li>
  <li>The pk6 files of the Pokémon you wish to upload</li>
  </ul>
  Please refer to the <a href="/extracting-pk6-files">Extracting pk6 files</a> help page for more information on how to obtain pk6 files.<br>

  </p>

  <p><b>How do I trade a Pokémon to someone?</b><br>
  Porybox does not have a trading interface, but you can use it to facilitate trades negotiated on other platforms.<br>
  <ol>
  <li>Show one of your viewable Pokémon to another person and agree to a trade.</li>
  <li>Complete the trade in-game, or exchange pk6 files through email or some other method.</li>
  <li>Delete the copy of your Pokémon from your account.</li>
  </ol>
  When you trade a Pokémon away, always be sure to delete your copy on Porybox. Otherwise, when the other person uploads its pk6 to Poybox, it will show up as a clone.</p>

  <p><b>What do Public, Visible, and Private mean?</b><br>
  <ul>
  <li>Viewable (default): the Pokémon can be viewed (but not downloaded) by other people. Sensitive information is hidden to the public.</li>
  <li>Public: anyone can view or download the Pokémon.</li>
  <li>Private: only you can view the Pokémon's data.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p><b>What do Listed and Unlisted mean?</b><br>
  <ul>
  <li>Listed (default): the box is listed on your user profile, and can be accessed either through that link or by directly visiting the URL.</li>
  <li>Unlisted: the box is not accessible from your user profile, but can be viewed by anyone with the URL.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Legality</h2>

  <p><b>What is considered a clone?</b><br>
  A Pokémon is considered a clone if another Pokémon exists in the Porybox database that shares all the following characteristics:<br>
  <ul>
  <li>OT</li>
  <li>TID (Trainer ID)</li>
  <li>SID (Secret ID)</li>
  <li>PID (Pokémon ID)</li>
  <li>EC (Encryption Constant)</li>
  <li>Evolutionary line</li>
  </ul>
  For static PID events, the IVs of the Pokémon must also match in addition to the criteria listed above.
  </p>
  
  <p><b>Can I edit Pokémon with Porybox?</b><br>
  Porybox is a Pokémon viewer, not an editor. You will not be able to edit your Pokémon with it.

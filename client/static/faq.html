    <h2 class="md-headline">Usage</h2>

    <p>
      <div class="md-body-2">How do I register?</div>
      Go the <a class="md-body-2" href="/">main page</a> and fill the form to create an account.
    </p>

    <p>
      <div class="md-body-2">How do I upload Pokémon?</div>
      To upload a Pokémon on Porybox, you need:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>A Porybox account</li>
        <li>A decrypted save file of your Pokémon game</li>
        <li>Or the pk6 files of the Pokémon you wish to upload</li>

      </ul>
      Please refer to the <a class="md-body-2" href="/#/extracting-pokemon-files">Extracting Pokémon</a> help page for more information on how
      to obtain pk6/pk7 files.<br/>

      When logged in, click on the + sign at the top of the page to upload save or pk6/pk7 files to a box of your choice.
    </p>

    <p>
      <div class="md-body-2">How do I trade a Pokémon to someone?</div>
        Porybox does not have a trading interface, but you can use it to facilitate trades negotiated on other
        platforms.
      <ol>
        <li>Show one of your viewable Pokémon to another person and agree to a trade.</li>
        <li>Complete the trade in-game, or exchange pk6 files through email or some other method.</li>
        <li>Delete the copy of your Pokémon from your account.</li>
      </ol>
      When you trade a Pokémon away, always be sure to delete your copy on Porybox. Otherwise, when the other person
      uploads its pk6 to Poybox, it will show up as a clone.
    </p>

    <p>
      <div class="md-body-2">What do Viewable, Public, and Private mean?</div>
      <ul>
        <li><i class="material-icons small" title="Viewable">visibility</i> Viewable (default): the Pokémon can be viewed (but not downloaded) by other people. Sensitive information, such as its PID and EC, is
          hidden to the public.
        </li>
        <li><i class="material-icons small" title="Viewable">public</i> Public: anyone can view or download the Pokémon.</li>
        <li><i class="material-icons small" title="Viewable">lock</i> Private: only you can view and download the Pokémon's data.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <div class="md-body-2">What do Listed and Unlisted mean?</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Listed (default): the box is listed on your user profile, and can be accessed either through that link or by
          directly visiting the URL.
        </li>
        <li><i class="material-icons unlisted-lock small">lock_outline</i> Unlisted: the box is not accessible from your user profile, but can be viewed by anyone with the URL.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      <div class="md-body-2">How do I use formatting in my notes?</div>
      See the <a class="md-body-2" href="/markdown">Markdown guide</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <div class="md-body-2">What is read-only mode?</div>
      Read-only mode is enabled when Porybox is under maintenance in order to protect your data.
      When read-only mode is on, you will still be able to view things that have already been uploaded, but you will not be able to upload files or change anything on your account or boxes.<br/>
      Maintenance usually does not last for more than a day. If Porybox is undergoing maintenance, you can check <a class="md-body-2" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/porybox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">/r/porybox</a> for more information.
    </p>

    <p>
      <div class="md-body-2">Is my data safe?</div>
      Your data is regularly backed up to an third-party server.
    </p>

    <h2 class="md-headline">Legality</h2>

    <p><div class="md-body-2">What is considered a clone?</div>
      A Pokémon is considered a clone if another Pokémon exists in the Porybox database that shares all the following
      characteristics:
      <ul>
        <li>OT</li>
        <li>TID (Trainer ID)</li>
        <li>SID (Secret ID)</li>
        <li>PID (Pokémon ID)</li>
        <li>EC (Encryption Constant)</li>
        <li>Evolutionary line</li>
      </ul>
      For static PID events, the IVs of the Pokémon must also match in addition to the criteria listed above.
    </p>

    <p>
      <div class="md-body-2">Can I edit Pokémon with Porybox?</div>
      Porybox is a Pokémon viewer, not an editor. You will not be able to edit your Pokémon with it.

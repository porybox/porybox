    <h2 class="md-headline">Initial breaking</h2>

    <p>You will only have to complete these steps once.</p>

    <ol>
    <li>Catch or breed six Pokémon. They have to originate from the game you wish to check shiny values on.</li>
    <li>Put them into the first row of the first box in your computer.</li>
    <li>Save the game.</li>
    <li>Soft reset (<code>L</code> + <code>R</code> + <code>Select</code>).</li>
    <li>Save the game again.</li>
    <li>Exit the game.</li>
    <li>Use either an SD Card reader or the MicroSD Management option to access your SD card. Navigate to this folder on your SD card:
    <ul>
    <li>If you have Sun, go to <code>Nintendo 3DS\x\x\title\00040000/00164800\data</code> (<code>x</code> being random letters/numbers).</li>
    <li>If you have Moon, go to <code>Nintendo 3DS\x\x\title\00040000/00175e00\data</code> (<code>x</code> being random letters/numbers).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Copy the file in the folder to a safe location on your PC. Rename that copy <code>16.sav</code>. <strong>Do not</strong> rename, move, or delete the original file on your SD card.</li>
    <li>Move the six Pokémon from box 1 to box 2. It is important that you preserve their order exactly.</li>
    <li>Save the game.</li>
    <li>Exit the game. There is no need to save twice this time. If you do, the process will fail.</li>
    <li>Browse to your save file on your SD card. Copy the file to a safe location on your PC. Rename that copy <code>165.sav</code>. Again, leave the original file on the SD card unaltered.</li>
    <li>In KeySAVe, go to the Breaking tab and open <code>16.sav</code> as <code>file 1</code> and <code>165.sav</code> as <code>file 2</code>. Click on <code>Break</code>. Your encryption key will be saved.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="md-headline">Breaking more boxes</h2>

    <p>After the initial decryption, only the first six slots of boxes 1 and 2 will be decrypted. KeySAVe will automatically decrypt more slots as you dump saves, but to hasten the process, follow these steps:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Empty every box you want to unlock. Create a backup of this save.</li>
    <li>Completely fill the boxes with any Pokémon (they do not have to be yours). Create a backup of this save.</li>
    <li>Move the Pokémon around, so that each slot contains a different Pokémon than it did in the previous save. Create a backup of this save.</li>
    <li>For each of the saves you created, open it in KeySAVe.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="md-headline">Further uses</h2>

    <p>Once the initial breaking is completed, simply follow these instructions:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>Move the Pokémon to a decrypted slot or box.</li>
    <li>Save the game.</li>
    <li>Copy the save file onto your computer.</li>
    <li>On KeySAVe, using the Dumping tab, open your save file.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Extracting Pokémon From Your Game</h1>

<div>

<p>
To upload and display a Pokémon on Porybox, you need to extract its information from your game. This information is stored as a pk6, which is simply a small file that contains all the data related to your Pokémon. You can upload the pk6 file to Porybox to have the Pokémon appear in one of your boxes.
</p>

<p>
There are several ways to obtain pk6 files from your games. Some require extra hardware or a console with a specific firmware version. Others require nothing more than an SD card reader.
</p>

<p>
The most common methods for obtaining the pk6 files of your Pokémon are:<br>
<ul>
<li>Reading Battle Videos</li>
<li>Running homebrew applications: svdt or JK’s save manager</li>
<li>Reading save files through KeySAV2 (Windows) or KeySAVe (Windows, Mac OS, Linux)</li>
<li>Using PowerSaves through the keystream method</li>
</ul>

Here is a handy table that lists the requirement for each of the methods above:<br>

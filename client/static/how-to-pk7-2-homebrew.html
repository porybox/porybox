    <h1 class="md-display-2">Method 2: Homebrew and save files</h1>

    <p>Homebrew is easier to install, but tends to be patched by Nintendo during firmware updates. Install a CFW if you can.</p>

    <h2 class="md-headline">Requirements</h2>

    <p>Requirements for current exploits allow for homebrew on most firmware versions. You will need:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>A console with a firmware version from 9.0.0 through 11.3.0.</li>
    <li>For other versions, refer to <a class="md-body-2" href="https://3ds.guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Plailect’s guide</a> for possible solutions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Use the <a class="md-body-2" href="https://3ds.guide/homebrew-launcher-(soundhax)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SoundHax section of Plailect’s guide</a> to install homebrew. Once your have access to homebrew, move on to the next step.</p>

    <h2 class="md-headline">JKSM</h2>

    <p>JKSM is a homebrew program that can export the save from your games. Grab the latest release of JKSM from <a class="md-body-2" href="https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSM/releases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>. Extract the files from the zip.</p>
    <ul>

    <li>If you are using homebrew, copy the <code>3ds</code> folder to your SD card and merge the content.</li>
    <li>If you have a CFW, you can install the CIA with <a class="md-body-2" href="https://github.com/Steveice10/FBI/releases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FBI</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Run JKSM. Pick <code>Cartridge</code> or <code>SD/CIA</code> depending on your game version, select the game, then export the save. Type in a name for the save, and validate. The file can be found in <code>\JSKV\Saves[game][name]</code>.</p>

    <p>If you have multiple saves backed up via JKSM for the same game, you need to be careful during the export process as the <code>New</code> option is not at the top by default. Pressing <code>A</code> one too many times could potentially overwrite a different save.</p>

    <h2 class="md-headline">Pokémon extraction</h2>

    <p>To extract Pokémon:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>Export your save file through JKSM.</li>
    <li>Copy the save file onto your computer.</li>
    <li>Upload the save file to Porybox.</li>
    </ol>

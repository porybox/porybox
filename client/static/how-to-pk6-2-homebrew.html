    <h1 class="md-display-2">Method 2: Homebrew and save files</h1>

    <p>Homebrew is easier to install, but tends to be patched by Nintendo during firmware updates. Install a CFW if you can.</p>

    <h2 class="md-headline">Requirements</h2>

    <p>Requirements for enabling homebrew differ depending on your firmware version. Refer to <a class="md-body-2" href="https://3ds.guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Plailect’s guide</a> to setup homebrew for your console.</p>

    <p>Once your have access to the Homebrew Launcher, you can move on to the next step of this guide. Alternatively, if you wish to install CFW to help ensure you retain homebrew access after future updates, proceed with the remaining sections of Plailect's guide and return here afterward.</p>
	
	<p>As of this writing on 2018/02/28, homebrew is useable on all consoles and firmware versions.</p>

    <h2 class="md-headline">JKSM</h2>

    <p>JKSM is a homebrew program that can export the save from your games. Grab the latest release of JKSM from <a class="md-body-2" href="https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSM/releases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>. Extract the files from the zip.</p>
    <ul>

    <li>If you are using homebrew, copy the <code>3ds</code> folder to your SD card and merge the content.</li>
    <li>If you have a CFW, you can install the CIA with <a class="md-body-2" href="https://github.com/Steveice10/FBI/releases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FBI</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Run JKSM. Pick <code>Cartridge</code> or <code>SD/CIA</code> depending on your game version, select the game, then export the save. Type in a name for the save, and validate. The file can be found in <code>\JSKV\Saves\[game]\[name]</code>.</p>

    <p>If you have multiple saves backed up via JKSM for the same game, you need to be careful during the export process as the <code>New</code> option is not at the top by default. Pressing <code>A</code> one too many times could potentially overwrite a different save.</p>

    <h2 class="md-headline">Pokémon extraction</h2>

    <p>To extract Pokémon:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>Export your save file through JKSM.</li>
    <li>Copy the save file onto your computer.</li>
    <li>Upload the save file to Porybox.</li>
    </ol>
